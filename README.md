> **⚠️ Attention:** There is an important point here. I used Google Firebase Cloud while using APIs. The credentials required to connect to Firebase are in a json and you have to add it to the main directory file. Since I have my firebase information in this project, I will not upload it to a public repo. I can provide it to you. All you have to do is take the json I provided and copy it to the root directory and copy its name and replace it with the 3rd line in the fireBaseConfig.ts file.
